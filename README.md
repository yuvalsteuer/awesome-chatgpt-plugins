### Creating a plugin:
- The steps for creating a plugin are ([Source](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins)):
  - Build an API with endpoints youâ€™d like a language model to call (this can be a new API, an existing API, or a wrapper around an existing API specifically designed for LLMs).
  - Create an OpenAPI specification documenting your API, and a manifest file that links to the OpenAPI spec and includes some plugin-specific metadata.
  - When starting a conversation on chat.openai.com, users can choose which third-party plugins theyâ€™d like to be enabled. Documentation about the enabled plugins is shown to the language model as part of the conversation context, enabling the model to invoke appropriate plugin APIs as needed to fulfill user intent. For now, plugins are designed for calling backend APIs, but we are exploring plugins that can call client-side APIs as well.
